<p>The Ligue 1 is the french professional league for men's association football and the highest league in France. Just like many other major leagues in Europe, it is made up of 20 top teams in the country who battle it out for the ligue 1 title. The standard Ligue 1 season is made up of 38 matches with each team playing same opponent on home ground and away from home. At the end of every season / campaign: </p>
<ul>
<li>The top teams finishing in 1st and 2nd positions will automatically participate in the UCL Competition for next season</li>
<li>the team that finished 3rd will play in the UEFA Champions League qualifications to book a spot in next season's Champions League group stage</li>
<li>the 4th team on the France Ligue 1 table enters straight into Europa League title race for next season</li>
<li>the bottom two teams are relegated automatically to the French Ligue 2, the second division of France football.</li>
<li>17th place finish on the table will join in the relegation play-offs to determine whether they will be in Ligue 1 next season or whether they will be relegated to ligue 2</li>
<li>The relegated teams are then replaced by: 
<ul>
<li>two clubs promoted from the Ligue 2, if the 17th place finishers qualified to play in the Ligue 1 next season</li>
<li>three clubs promoted from the Ligue 2, if the 17th place finishers were unable to retain their spot in the Ligue 1</li>
</ul></li>
